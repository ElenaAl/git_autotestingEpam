 tralalalalala
I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all of my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave

'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
